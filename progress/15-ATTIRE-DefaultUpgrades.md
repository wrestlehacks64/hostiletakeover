# Log 15 - Default Upgrades

Added a [references](./references/) folder to the project today before getting started. I often lose my spot or get distracted, so it's easier just to dump and keep that one tab open.

Upgraded some default attires today.

Scott Steiner, added his studded weight belt. I drew one that looked awesome, but had too much colors. Then, I remembered there was a good one from World Tour, so I took that. Research says he kinda pulled it to the left, but I kept it centered to be more uniform.

Knee pads were a problem area. I've been using VPW2 & WM2000 accessories for the most part. But in Revenge, you have to account for the red skin color alpha channel which takes up ~8 colors. *(I think I mentioned it in another update)*

I had 3 colors left for the kneepads and had to be a little creative to have some shading. Boots were from VPW2. I didn't add the little tassel thing he wore. I'll check more references to see if it was

Curt Henning was randomly next. Anyone who says that they like modding singlets is a liar. Thought this would be a quick one, but took some time to better align the colors and tweak the alpha channels so they're more equal during color change. The chest and the groin were originally mismatched with the stomach.

Also, the default black on the back of his singlet was solid. So I added some texture. Nothing major, just doesn't look so flat anymore.

Finished Hennig off with some knee pads and boots.

Last of the default bunch was the base for the Faces of Fear. Mostly just upgrading the skull, adding more authentic boots, and the black wrist tape.

Much like other primary attires that have a similar variation, if there is space, I'd like to add one with the *Faces of Fear* text. I'm also looking forward to making a custom head for Meng and his wild hair from this time. 

That's it for today.
