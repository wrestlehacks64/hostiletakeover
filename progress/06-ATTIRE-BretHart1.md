# Log 06 - Attire / Bret Hart 1

Finally decided to tackle a more complex attire and chose Bret Hart.

His in game attire needs minor tweaking.

- Redraw singlet skull
- Realign singlet between Chest/Stomach
- Edit HITTIH on the trunks to HITMAN
- Redraw + align hearts on Upper Right Leg
- Add proper elbow pads
- Add Wristbands
- Add Custom Boots

My first singlet, I see that the skin colors will take up approx ~8 colors on a 16-color palette, so you have to be smart with what you draw.

After a lot of pixel editing across the attire, I was happy with the result.

The boots were fun to draw. I prefer editing the accessories, because they can make the character unique. And yes, the elbow pads say Bike *(or at least a very pixelated version)* on the back.

I might go back and :

1) Edit the pants skull a little more
2) Change the default pink to a brighter saturation. Right now it's the default "in game" colors.
3) Make the Wrist Bands changable with Color 1 (Pink wristbands?)

These were my two favorite color 1 / color 2 variants.

I might refine the alpha channels so they are a little darker, but I'm done for now.
