# Log 12 - Attire / Sting 3

The frustrations with this attire almost made me want to quit the entire project. But, this is one of the most important *"I wish they had that attire in the game"* changes. 

Everyone hates the default Sting singlet with the scorpion logo on the chest. People prefer the Starrcade 97 version which can be a modder's nightmare.

I needed to split one large logo across the following body parts : 

1) Chest
2) Stomach
3) Waist
4) Left Upper Leg

This is also where you get a rude awakening that you can't just *copy and paste* resources from other texture mod projects. I tried to use WWF No Mercy Feel The Bang's Sting... and it was just a blob. 

After tons of pixel work, I was finally happy with the results.

It was so challenging, I didn't even bother with editing the gloves, so I'll have to go back later.

The boots are pulled from WM2000 -- those big clunky 30/31 types? -- with some added straps. 

It looks great during a match and I'm really glad I added it.
