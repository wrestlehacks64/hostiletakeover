# Log 10 - Attire / Harlem Heat 1

Tenth day working through this project. I try to work on it a little bit each day, even if it's searching for 1 line of gameshark code. 

Today, I wanted to fix up Harlem Heat. Mostly, just the flame on the upper body attire and try to add text.

An attempt at skewed, pixel text "HARLEM HEAT"

It works alright in game, but maybe I'm my brain's conditioned into *knowing* that's what it says.

I also fixed some alignment issues and added different boots. 

And another minor change. I went through so many pictures and video to see if they ever used a white ring on their attire (used in the default REVENGE game), and I could never find one. So I changed it to a black ring. 

I want to make a second attire that follows this pattern : 

- Purple primary color
- Red Flame outline
- Yellow inside flame
- New Forearm bands
- Remove hand

I might use Booker's topless tights, as I'm not sure he used those until later 98.

That's it for today.
