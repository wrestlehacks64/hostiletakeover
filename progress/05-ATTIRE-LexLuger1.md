# Log 05 - Attire / Lex Luger 1

Just wanted another simple "trunks" attire. Decided to go with Lex Luger.

Default Setup : 
- Black Trunks
- Black Kneepads
- White Boots

The Trunks and Kneepads are Color 1, and can be changed to hit different Lex Luger timelines. 

Boots occupy color two, best either White or Black (Default). People can change it to whatever they want on their game.

Had a mistake and remembered wrong about some of Luger's classic attires. 

Example : 

- Blue Trunks
- Black Kneepads
- White Boots

I might include that as secondary attire if there is space. 

There's also the issue of the armbands. He didn't wear them *as much* during this time period, but I know people would want them.
