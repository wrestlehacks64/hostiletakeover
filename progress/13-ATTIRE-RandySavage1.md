# Log 13 - Attire / Randy Savage 1

Today is the anniversary of the Bash at the Beach 96 pay-per-view, an event that somewhat sparked this project. 

I decided it was time to do another "advanced" attire mod, so I picked Randy Savage's split star attire. It's not really advanced, just something that takes a lot of alignment and palette planning.

For the default color, I went with the bright fluorescent yellow and pink. Some color changes and you can re-create his Red/Yellow (Slim Jim-style) or a cool Black/White.

The star placement isn't 100% accurate. I learned more about the "stretch" distortion in the thigh region, so I had to move them over a little bit. They're also not angled 10ยบ. Trust me, I tried. But I lost the shape in the pixelation.

Also, I needed a good lower leg for the wide tassel area. A common idea is to use a Jeans polygon. In Revenge (and maybe other games), using a jean model also expands the hip area. Since these are tights w/ tassels, I decided to :

1) Import a full Medium tights (0008) body onto an unused body shape.
2) Import a normal jeans lower leg onto the unused body shape's lower leg.
3) Connect the lower leg with the knee area of the upper leg
4) Widen the left, right, and back sections of the lower leg 3-hex.

These pants might be good for Disco Inferno too? Not sure yet. 

And just to finish Macho up, added a new taped hand and wasted a texture for 20 pixels of finger tape.  

I also spent most of my day migrating all of my logs from Substack onto GitHub. I like the platform and ease of adding updates. Hopefully I can take better advantage of the resources. But, I feel out of place when not coding or building software.
