# Log 11 - Attire / DDP 1

I posted a general inquiry on Reddit, asking what people didn't like about the appearances in the original game. Most were general replies. Remove Scott Hall wristbands. Change ____ attire. Fix someone's hair color.

The one that stuck out, was remove DDP's "Diamond Cutter" shirt from his wrestling attire - Medium 9.

Some basic coding, pulling his chest tatt from Medium 7 and a normal stomach value, I removed the shirt.

Then, researched pictures and video of DDP during this period. I learned that he had multiple color variations of these tights. In the default game, you can  change the t-shirt color and the black tights color, but not the waistband and diamond. 

I reorganized the color palette to allow for more customization. Here are some examples (Default first):

I also upgraded the boots and added black glove tape around the hands. 

If I have space, I want to do his more colorful 1996 attire. And of course, I have to make a taped rib variant.
