# Log 07 - Stinger

I finally decided to edit my favorite WCW wrestler today.

I wanted to do two specific attires :

- STINGER "rainbow"
- Surfer Scorpion

The "Stinger" rainbow was a challenge. The primary color was black with multiple pastel colors (Yellow, Blue, Green, Orange, Pink)

Black tights are, at minimum, 6 colors. So I needed to split the other 5 colors down to 2 each. A primary light and a secondary dark for shading. This is how restrictive this palette is :

I drew the "STINGER" text down the leg, zooming in to 15:1 multiple times to make sure the letters connect between Waist/Upper Leg/Lower Leg.

On the other side, I hand-drew a scorpion from memory. It's blocky from the limited palette, but looks nice during gameplay. 

I also needed to edit the finger tape to make it left-hand only. Just small coding implemented in the ROM.

Default boot color, I went with green (Bash at the Beach 96) and they can be changed to match Sting's other looks.

Next was the traditional "Surfer" scorpion tights. 

Tried something new - I asked Gemini (Google's AI) to generate a multi-sized sprite sheet for a pixel scorpion, one that I could use as a template for the logo.

While not quite 100% accurate for Sting, it did give a good foundation for drawing a custom scorpion.

Decided to keep the default colors of the in-game original attire.

I'm not happy with the inside claw. It needs more of a vertical angle, but it was in the "stretch zone" of the thigh and didn't look right.

Another thing I forgot was to split the boot color so that he has a black sole. While the variants look great, I have a feeling that there will be some purist out there demanding black soles.

I might go back later and make these tiny fixes, but for now, I am quitting for the day.
