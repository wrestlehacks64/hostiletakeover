# Log 04 - Attire / Ric Flair 1

Starting my first wrestler mod, I decided to make Ric Flair. I thought it would be a simple intro to editing in-game graphics.

For this project, I am pulling additional graphic resources from both **Virtual Pro Wrestling 2** and **Wrestlemania 2000**, as all three games share the same body polygons from the neck down.

I also changed the foot polygons before getting started, by importing the shapes from Wrestlemania 2000. They're about the same, but the graphic mapping is heel-to-toe, while default Revenge is toe-to-heel. I don't know. Years of modding No Mercy, I just can't see myself learning to make feet backwards. 

### Ric Flair - Wrestling Attire 1 

Picked Default M-19 (British Bulldog 2) as it had the non-mirrored lower legs that I could use for the "RF" boot text. 

Decided to go with :
- Classic trunks
  - Red Primary
  - White RF script
- Black Knee Pads
- Red Boots / White RF

Because Bulldog 2 had extra accessories, I had to code those off with other parts. 

This was the final product :

It's a versatile default setup and you can get some very good variantions with color changes, spanning back to the eighties.

I might go back and make the kneepads a little larger, but I think I'll let it rest for now.
