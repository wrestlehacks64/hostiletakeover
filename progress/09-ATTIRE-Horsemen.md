# Log 09 - Attire / Horsemen

Watching Nitro, I was inspired to work on the Horsemen (and Jeff Jarrett). 

First, **"Double A" Arn Anderson**. Arn doesn't really fit the large-body category, so I need to go back and make a medium-large body that's wide, but not so thick.

I still don't know how to double-up identical colors in the palette yet. For example Black 1 with a Color 1 alpha channel and Black 2 unchangeable. So I decided to do this basic setup for Arn.

- Red Trunks w/ White AA
- Red Kneepads
- Red and Silver Boots.

I also needed to add torso hair, so I pulled values from Goldberg.

This was the final default attire

Some of my favorite color combinations :

Next, **Chris Benoit**.

Didn't really need to do much here. The default tights look great in this style. I only made some minor palette tweaks so you can change the color of the 4 and the crotch area.

I also upgraded his boots and gave him a set of longer wristbands. He didn't quite have that long forearm tape *(ex. WWF/WWE)*, but it was still slightly longer than the other wristbands.

Another attire planned is 

Then, **Steve "Mongo" McMichael**. 

That reminds me. I really want to add Debra in this game, but need to figure out how to get her long gown. The polgyons don't really allow it. WM2000 introduced an "extra shape" that can connect certain parts -- skirt/towel/robe/etc. Maybe later.

Still not knowing how to properly do multiple black colors, I stuck with Dark Blue & Orange that can be changed to the more normal Black/White.

The 76 has a certain "curve" to it, which makes it difficult to get 100% right, but it looks good in the game. It's narrowly between two stretch zones that will distort it.

Minor detail, but added the finger double-tape. 

Finally, **"Double J" Jeff Jarrett**. Not really a Horseman in my eyes (or some of the other guys), but I wrapped up my day with this one. 

The most common outfit of that WCW era was : 

- White Strap top w/ Gold center
- White Tights w/ Gold Pattern
- Gold Boots

The gold and white follow the same alpha channel gradient, so it's easy to have an all white. 

You can also mix and match wilder color combinations from his mid-90s WWF days, but they're not as sparkly and the gold boots don't match the J. I had another type of boots. Gold with black soles and white side panels, ones that he wore a few times in WCW, but they looked too "messy" during gameplay. 


I just wanted to address this common question people are probably wondering : 

> Hey, why aren't you previewing heads too?

I have a complex plan for redesigning the attires and I want a clear picture of what image assets are available before I start coding the heads. If I was doing a texture-based mod, I'd do the full wrestler first, and then move on to the next.
