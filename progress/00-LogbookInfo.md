# Logbook Naming Guide

To keep my development logs clear, consistent, and easy to navigate, I use the following filename format:

[log-number]-[CATEGORY]-[ShortTitle].md


### Format Breakdown:
- **log-number** — A two-digit number for chronological order (e.g., 01, 02, 03).
- **CATEGORY** — The main focus area in ALL CAPS (e.g., GENERAL, CODING, ATTIRE).
- **ShortTitle** — A brief description of the log content.

### Examples:

| Filename                    | What it means                     |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `01-GENERAL-Roster.md`      | Log about planning the roster     |
| `02-CODING-CostumeData.md`  | Progress on attire coding         |
| `03-ATTIRE-RicFlair1.md`    | Notes about Ric Flair’s attire    |

### About the Categories

- **GENERAL**  
  Used for overall planning, ideas, brainstorming, and miscellaneous notes that don’t fit into a specific technical area.

- **CODING**  
  Covers all programming and technical work related to the ROM hack — such as scripting, debugging, and patching.

- **ATTIRE**  
  Focuses on wrestler costumes, outfits, and appearance tweaks or customizations.

- **ARENA**  
  Covers modifications to ring design, arena backgrounds, crowd, lighting, and overall stage presentation.

- **INTERFACE**  
  User interface tweaks such as menus, HUD elements, and navigation improvements.

- **AUDIO**  
  Includes work on sound effects, music, and any audio-related modifications.

- **TESTING**  
  Logs about playtesting sessions, bug reports, gameplay feedback, and QA notes.

### Why this system?

- The number keeps logs in **chronological order**.
- The **CAPS category** stands out visually for quick filtering.
- The short title keeps filenames **simple and readable**.
- Overall, this structure helps me stay organized and focused on what matters.
