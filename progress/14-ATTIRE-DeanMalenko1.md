# Log 14 - Attire / Dean Malenko 

After a few more detailed attires, I just need an easy one today. I'm also doing something on Wrestlemania 2000, so I also wanted a short break from Revenge to restrict burnout. 

Decided to work on Dean Malenko's default attire. I don't like the original game, where the black trunks and knee pads are color-linked. While he did wear other primary color trunks, I decided to keep these black and add an outline on the pattern to allow color changes on that. Also, fixed the boots and kneepads. This is a comparison of a the before (Default Game) and after (ROM hack).

If you've played Revenge a lot, maybe you won't notice the small tweaks such as the boot length or wristband size. 

You lose *some* sharpness on the points with the two color's outline shading. Here's an in match shot where it doesn't look so noticable :

*Note to self - Dean Malenko and Rey Mysterio are the same height in this game... need to fix that*

His kneepad type and with/without socks varied over the years. After watching WCW Nitro 97 episodes, I decided to keep what was more used. Supporter + without socks. 

Here's some example color changes on the attire.

*after making this log update, I went back and removed a few pixels off the upper leg so the kneepads aren't so "long"*

*If there's space*, I might consider an alternate where you can change the black, but then that will lock the outline as black.  

I started working on Jericho's Fall Brawl 97 attire, one of my favorite from his WCW run. But couldn't line up the pattern so well. I might look to another for guidance.

Not much progress today, but there's progress.
