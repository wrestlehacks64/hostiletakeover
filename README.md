# Hostile Takeover

![wcwnwo-hostiletakeover](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb7cde9a-213f-49e7-a596-3dad292967b9)

A custom ROM hack of **WCW/nWo Revenge** for the Nintendo 64.

This project recreates the formative era of the New World Order — from Scott Hall’s shocking 1996 WCW Monday Nitro debut to the chaotic buildup of Souled Out in January 1998.
